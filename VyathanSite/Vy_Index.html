            <p>Hi, welcome to <strong>Vyathan Design</strong>. My name is <em>Matt Brundage</em> and I am an independant, freelance, Web Developer located in Central Michigan. I specialize in building websites for clients that value long-term synergetic relationships. I build new websites for people, businesses, or brands, and I revise exsisting websites too. In addition, I also provide technical SEO (Search Engine Optimization) audits, website maintenance, and website hosting.</p>

            <p>The websites I build use the latest and most reliable front-end languages like HTML5 and CSS3. I am also skilled with JavaScript and frameworks like React and Vue, allowing me to add interactive functionality to your site. Because I freelance I am able to keep my overhead low and pass the savings on to you in the form of some of the most reasonable prices in the industry.</p>

            <p>Having attended <a href="https://montcalm.edu">Montcalm Community College</a>'s <a href="https://www.montcalm.edu/sub-header/academics/degrees/web-developer-programming-associate-degree/">Associate of Science - Web Developer & Programming</a> program, as well as preparing to attend <a href="https://www.cmich.edu/Pages/default.aspx">Central Michigan University</a>'s <a href="https://go.cmich.edu/academics/Undergraduate/Find_Program/Pages/Computer_Science.aspx">Bachelor of Science - Computer Science</a> program, I have learned the practical application of Web Development skills needed to complete even your most challenging projects.</p>
